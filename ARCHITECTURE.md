# Architecture Documentation

The Event Discovery Platform is architected using **Next.js (App Router)** to leverage modern React Server Components for performance, SEO, and scalability. Each route under `/[locale]` is built as a server-rendered page by default, ensuring that event listings and metadata are pre-rendered for optimal search engine visibility. Data fetching is performed using **async Server Components** (e.g., `getEvents` and `getEventBySlug`) that read from mock JSON data, simulating a backend API layer. Client Components are used selectively where interactivity is required — such as in the **EventFilter**, **Book Ticket form**, and navigation — following the “server by default, client when necessary” pattern.

The platform is designed around **clean separation of concerns**. Presentation logic (UI components like `EventCard`, `EventGrid`, and `TicketsTable`) is isolated from data fetching and routing logic in the `/lib` and `/app` layers. This modular structure improves reusability and maintainability. The **locale-aware routing** (`/[locale]/...`) provides bilingual support (English and Arabic) without requiring an external i18n library, using layout-level direction control (`dir="rtl"` for Arabic). Tailwind CSS powers the styling with a fully responsive, mobile-first design, while maintaining accessibility and consistent UI spacing through utility classes.

SEO and performance were key architectural priorities. The app uses the **Next.js Metadata API** for dynamic meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter cards. Each event detail page includes **structured data (JSON-LD)** to improve discoverability by search engines. A **dynamic sitemap** and `robots.txt` further enhance crawlability. All pages include **loading skeletons** for perceived performance, and data is cached where possible for efficient re-renders. This architecture achieves the balance between modern React practices, high SEO standards, and clean, scalable frontend design.
